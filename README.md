# naive_mc_music

Needs numpy, pyosc, and SuperCollider to work.

Made to illustrate various points:
  - Markov Chain sampling.
  - A method which sample uniformly from the space of partitions restricted to powers of two, of a given whole number.
  - Simple use of OSC to connect Python to Supercollider.
  - Also, to hear some polyrhythms... I fucking love polyrhythms.
